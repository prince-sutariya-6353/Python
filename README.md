## Getting Started

These scripts require Python 3.x to run. No additional dependencies are required for most scripts.

### Running a script

```bash
python script_name.py
```

## Learning Goals

This repository demonstrates my progress in learning Python, focusing on:

- Basic syntax and programming concepts
