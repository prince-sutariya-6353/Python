## üéØ Learning Goals

This repository demonstrates my progress in learning Python, focusing on:

- Basic syntax and programming concepts
- Object-oriented programming principles
- File and data handling
- Building practical command-line applications
- Writing clean, maintainable code

## üìù Notes

- Most scripts contain comments explaining the code functionality
- Mini projects demonstrate more complex applications of Python concepts
- This is an ongoing repository that will be updated as I learn new concepts
